1. [Mark and Toys](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/mark-and-toys/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=sorting) -  go to this link for full description or to try it by yourself
  * Solution desciption:
      1. We need to sort our array of prices in ASCENDING order.
      2. Create a for loop to go trough each number in array.
      3. Create counter variable so you can count how may items you will be able to get
      4. Create sum variable to hold sum of prices 
      5. And add condition: sum items in array until you get to the desired price.
      6. Tell yourself: "Awesome Job!!! :)"
